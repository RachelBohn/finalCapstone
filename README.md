# My Favourite Sweet Recipes

## Description

This project is a website diplaying sweet recipes split in three categories, each of them containing two recipes:
* cakes
  * carrot cake
  * cake with chocolate chips
* cookies
  * cookies with chocolate chips
  * brownies-cookies - cookies with a chocolate melting heart
* pies
  * pear almond and chocolate chips tart
  * apple pie

For each recipe, users can:
* leave a comment
* like a recipe
* bookmark a recipe

When users bookmark a recipe:
* the name and the URI of that specific recipe are saved on the "Saved For Later" page. This allows users to easily find recipes when they leave the website and come back later
* an alert pops up to let users know how many recipes are saved

Besides recipes and "Saved For Later" pages, the website also contains:
* A home page as an introduction 
* A "contact me" page to allow users to send me an email
